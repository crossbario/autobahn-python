WAMP Programming
================

This guide gives an introduction to programming with `WAMP <http://wamp.ws>`__ in Python using |Ab|.

WAMP provides two communication patterns for application components to talk to each other

* :ref:`remote-procedure-calls`
* :ref:`publish-and-subscribe`

and we will cover all four interactions involved in above patterns

1. :ref:`registering-procedures` for remote calling
2. :ref:`calling-procedures` remotely
3. :ref:`subscribing-to-topics` for receiving events
4. :ref:`publishing-events` to topics

.. tip::
   If you are new to WAMP or want to learn more about the design principles behind WAMP, we have a longer text `here <http://wamp.ws/why/>`__.

------

Application Components
----------------------

WAMP is all about creating systems from loosely coupled *application components*. It's application components where your application specific code runs.

A WAMP based system consists of potentially many application components, which all connect to a WAMP router. The router is *generic*, which means, it does *not* run any application code, but only provides routing of events and calls.

Hence, to create a WAMP application, you 

1. write application components
2. connect the components to a router


.. _creating-components:

Creating Components
...................

You create an application component by deriving from a base class provided by |ab|.

When using **Twisted**, you derive from :class:`autobahn.twisted.wamp.ApplicationSession`

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   from autobahn.twisted.wamp import ApplicationSession

   class MyComponent(ApplicationSession):

      def onJoin(self, details):
         print("session ready")

whereas when you are using **asyncio**, you derive from :class:`autobahn.asyncio.wamp.ApplicationSession`

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   from autobahn.asyncio.wamp import ApplicationSession

   class MyComponent(ApplicationSession):

      def onJoin(self, details):
         print("session ready")

As can be seen, the only difference between Twisted and asyncio is the import (line 1). The rest of the code is identical.

Also, |ab| will invoke callbacks on your application component when certain events happen. For example, :func:`autobahn.wamp.interfaces.ISession.onJoin` is triggered when the WAMP session has connected to a router and joined a realm. We'll come back to this topic later.


.. _running-components:

Running Components
..................

To actually make use of an application components, the component needs to connect to a WAMP router.
|Ab| includes a *runner* that does the heavy lifting for you.

Here is how you use :class:`autobahn.twisted.wamp.ApplicationRunner` with **Twisted**

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   from autobahn.twisted.wamp import ApplicationRunner

   runner = ApplicationRunner(url = u"ws://localhost:8080/ws", realm = u"realm1")
   runner.run(MyComponent)

and here is how you use :class:`autobahn.asyncio.wamp.ApplicationRunner` with **asyncio**

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   from autobahn.asyncio.wamp import ApplicationRunner

   runner = ApplicationRunner(url = u"ws://localhost:8080/ws", realm = u"realm1")
   runner.run(MyComponent)

As can be seen, the only difference between Twisted and asyncio is the import (line 1). The rest of the code is identical.

There are two mandatory arguments to ``ApplicationRunner``:

1. ``url``: the WebSocket URL of the WAMP router (for WAMP-over-WebSocket)
2. ``realm``: the *Realm* the component should join on that router

.. tip::
   A *Realm* is a routing namespace and an administrative domain for WAMP. For example, a single WAMP router can manage multiple *Realms*, and those realms are completely separate: an event published to topic T on a Realm R1 is NOT received by a subscribe to T on Realm R2.


Here are quick templates for you to copy/paste for creating and running a WAMP component.

**Twisted**:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   from autobahn.twisted.wamp import ApplicationSession, ApplicationRunner

   class MyComponent(ApplicationSession):

      def onJoin(self, details):
         print("session joined")

   if __name__ == '__main__':
      runner = ApplicationRunner(url = u"ws://localhost:8080/ws", realm = u"realm1")
      runner.run(MyComponent)

**asyncio**:

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   from autobahn.asyncio.wamp import ApplicationSession, ApplicationRunner

   class MyComponent(ApplicationSession):

      def onJoin(self, details):
         print("session joined")

   if __name__ == '__main__':
      runner = ApplicationRunner(url = u"ws://localhost:8080/ws", realm = u"realm1")
      runner.run(MyComponent)


Running a WAMP Router
---------------------

The component we've created attempts to connect to a **WAMP router** running locally which accepts connections on port ``8080``, and for a realm ``realm1``.

Our suggested way is to use `Crossbar.io <http://crossbar.io>`_ as your WAMP router.

.. tip::

   There are other WAMP routers besides Crossbar.io as well. Please see this `list <http://wamp.ws/implementations#routers>`__.

Once you've `installed Crossbar.io <http://crossbar.io/docs/Quick-Start/>`_, initialize an instance of it with the default settings, which will accept WAMP (over WebSocket) connections on ``ws://<hostname>:8080/ws`` and has a ``realm1`` pre-configured.

To do this, do

.. code-block:: sh

   crossbar init

This will create the default Crossbar.io node configuration ``.crossbar/config.json``. You can then start Crossbar.io by doing 

.. code-block:: sh

   crossbar start


.. _remote-procedure-calls:

Remote Procedure Calls
----------------------

**Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** is a messaging pattern involving peers of three roles:

* *Caller*
* *Callee*
* *Dealer*

A *Caller* issues calls to remote procedures by providing the procedure URI and any arguments for the call. The *Callee* will execute the procedure using the supplied arguments to the call and return the result of the call to the Caller.

*Callees* register procedures they provide with *Dealers*. *Callers* initiate procedure calls first to *Dealers*. *Dealers* route calls incoming from *Callers* to *Callees* implementing the procedure called, and route call results back from *Callees* to *Callers*.

The *Caller* and *Callee* will usually run application code, while the *Dealer* works as a generic router for remote procedure calls decoupling *Callers* and *Callees*.


.. _registering-procedures:

Registering Procedures
......................

To make a procedure available for remote calling, the procedure needs to be *registered*. Registering a procedure is done by calling :func:`autobahn.wamp.interfaces.ICallee.register` from a session.

Here is an example using **Twisted**

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 15

   from autobahn.twisted.wamp import ApplicationSession
   from twisted.internet.defer import inlineCallbacks


   class MyComponent(ApplicationSession):
   
      @inlineCallbacks
      def onJoin(self, details):
         print("session ready")

         def add2(x, y):
            return x + y

         try:
            yield self.register(add2, u'com.myapp.add2')
            print("procedure registered")
         except Exception as e:
            print("could not register procedure: {0}".format(e))

The procedure ``add2`` is registered (line 14) under the URI ``u"com.myapp.add2"`` immediately in the ``onJoin`` callback which fires when the session has connected to a *Router* and joined a *Realm*.

.. tip::

   You can register *local* functions like in above example, *global* functions as well as *methods* on class instances. Further, procedures can also be automatically registered using *decorators*.

When the registration succeeds, authorized callers will immediately be able to call the procedure (see :ref:`calling-procedures`) using the URI under which it was registered (``u"com.myapp.add2"``).

A registration may also fail, e.g. when a procedure is already registered under the given URI or when the session is not authorized to register procedures.

Using **asyncio**, the example looks like this

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 14

   from autobahn.asyncio.wamp import ApplicationSession
   from asyncio import coroutine

   class MyComponent(ApplicationSession):

      @coroutine
      def onJoin(self, details):
         print("session ready")

         def add2(x, y):
            return x + y

         try:
            yield from self.register(add2, u'com.myapp.add2')
            print("procedure registered")
         except Exception as e:
            print("could not register procedure: {0}".format(e))

The differences compared with the Twisted variant are:

* the ``import`` of ``ApplicationSession``
* the use of ``@coroutine`` to decorate co-routines
* the use of ``yield from`` instead of ``yield``


.. _calling-procedures:

Calling Procedures
..................

Calling a procedure (that has been previously registered) is done using :func:`autobahn.wamp.interfaces.ICaller.call`.

Here is how you would call the procedure ``add2`` that we registered in :ref:`registering-procedures` under URI ``com.myapp.add2`` in **Twisted**

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 12

   from autobahn.twisted.wamp import ApplicationSession
   from twisted.internet.defer import inlineCallbacks


   class MyComponent(ApplicationSession):

      @inlineCallbacks
      def onJoin(self, details):
         print("session ready")

         try:
            res = yield self.call(u'com.myapp.add2', 2, 3)
            print("call result: {}".format(res))
         except Exception as e:
            print("call error: {0}".format(e))

And here is the same done on **asyncio**

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 12

   from autobahn.asyncio.wamp import ApplicationSession
   from asyncio import coroutine


   class MyComponent(ApplicationSession):

      @coroutine
      def onJoin(self, details):
         print("session ready")

         try:
            res = yield from self.call(u'com.myapp.add2', 2, 3)
            print("call result: {}".format(res))
         except Exception as e:
            print("call error: {0}".format(e))


.. _publish-and-subscribe:

Publish & Subscribe
-------------------

**Publish & Subscribe (PubSub)** is a messaging pattern involving peers of three roles:

* *Publisher*
* *Subscriber*
* *Broker*

A *Publishers* publishes events to topics by providing the topic URI and any payload for the event. Subscribers of the topic will receive the event together with the event payload.

*Subscribers* subscribe to topics they are interested in with *Brokers*. *Publishers* initiate publication first at *Brokers*. *Brokers* route events incoming from *Publishers* to *Subscribers* that are subscribed to respective topics.

The *Publisher* and *Subscriber* will usually run application code, while the *Broker* works as a generic router for events decoupling *Publishers* from *Subscribers*.


.. _subscribing-to-topics:

Subscribing to Topics
.....................

To receive events published to a topic, a session needs to first subscribe to the topic.

Subscribing to a topic is done by calling :func:`autobahn.wamp.interfaces.ISubscriber.subscribe`.

Here is a **Twisted** example

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 15

   from autobahn.twisted.wamp import ApplicationSession
   from twisted.internet.defer import inlineCallbacks


   class MyComponent(ApplicationSession):

      @inlineCallbacks
      def onJoin(self, details):
         print("session ready")

         def oncounter(count):
            print("event received: {0}", count)

         try:
            yield self.subscribe(oncounter, u'com.myapp.oncounter')
            print("subscribed to topic")
         except Exception as e:
            print("could not subscribe to topic: {0}".format(e))

We create an event handler function ``oncounter`` (you can name that as you like) which will get called whenever an event for the topic is received.

To subscribe (line 15), we provide the event handler function (``oncounter``) and the URI of the topic to which we want to subscribe (``u'com.myapp.oncounter'``).

When the subscription succeeds, we will receive any events published to ``u'com.myapp.oncounter'``. Note that we won't receive events published *before* the subscription succeeds.

The corresponding **asyncio** code looks like this

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 15

   from autobahn.asyncio.wamp import ApplicationSession
   from asyncio import coroutine


   class MyComponent(ApplicationSession):

      @coroutine
      def onJoin(self, details):
         print("session ready")

         def oncounter(count):
            print("event received: {0}", count)

         try:
            yield from self.subscribe(oncounter, u'com.myapp.oncounter')
            print("subscribed to topic")
         except Exception as e:
            print("could not subscribe to topic: {0}".format(e))

Again, nearly identical to Twisted.


.. _publishing-events:

Publishing Events
.................

Publishing an event to a topic is done by calling :func:`autobahn.wamp.interfaces.IPublisher.publish`.

Events can carry arbitrary positional and keyword based payload - as long as the payload is serializable in JSON.

Here is a **Twisted** example that will publish an event to topic ``u'com.myapp.oncounter'`` with a single (positional) payload being a counter that is incremented for each publish

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 14

   from autobahn.twisted.wamp import ApplicationSession
   from autobahn.twisted.util import sleep
   from twisted.internet.defer import inlineCallbacks


   class MyComponent(ApplicationSession):

      @inlineCallbacks
      def onJoin(self, details):
         print("session ready")

         counter = 0
         while True:
            self.publish(u'com.myapp.oncounter', counter)
            counter += 1
            yield sleep(1)

The corresponding **asyncio** code looks like this

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 14

   from autobahn.asyncio.wamp import ApplicationSession
   from asyncio import sleep
   from asyncio import coroutine


   class MyComponent(ApplicationSession):

      @coroutine
      def onJoin(self, details):
         print("session ready")

         counter = 0
         while True:
            self.publish(u'com.myapp.oncounter', counter)
            counter += 1
            yield from sleep(1)


.. tip::
   By default, a publisher will not receive an event it publishes even when the publisher is *itself* subscribed to the topic subscribed to. This behavior can be overridden.

.. tip::
   By default, publications are *unacknowledged*. This means, a ``publish()`` may fail *silently* (like when the session is not authorized to publish to the given topic). This behavior can be overridden.


.. _inlinecallbacks-and-coroutine:

@inlineCallbacks & @coroutine
---------------------------

``inlineCallbacks`` (**Twisted**) and ``coroutine`` (**asyncio**) are two decorators providing an elegant way to write asynchronous code without using any callback. 

Classically, an asynchronous code would be:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    
    def async_process():
        """Returns a Deferred."""
    
    def on_error(err):
        print("Error: {}".format(err))
        print("After.")
    
    def on_success(res):
        print("Success: {}".format(res))
        print("After.")
    
    def func():
        print("Before.")
        
        deferred = async_process()
        
        deferred.add_callback(on_success)
        deferred.add_errback(on_error)
        
        
Ugly, isn't it? Instead, let's use the decorators mentionned above:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    
    from __future__ import print_function
    
    def async_process():
        """Returns a Deferred."""
    
    @inlineCallbacks # Or: @coroutine
    def func():
        print("Before.")
        
        try:
            res = yield async_process()
            print("Success: {}".format(res))
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error: {}".format(e))
        finally:
            print("After.")
        

.. _session_lifecycle:

Session Lifecycle
-----------------

A WAMP application component has this lifecycle:

1. component created
2. transport connected
3. authentication challenge received (only for authenticated WAMP sessions)
4. session established (realm joined)
5. session closed (realm left)
6. transport disconnected

The `ApplicationSession` will fire the following events which you can handle by overriding the respective method (see :class:`autobahn.wamp.interfaces.ISession` for more information):

.. code-block:: python

   class MyComponent(ApplicationSession):

      def __init__(self, config = None):
         ApplicationSession.__init__(self, config)
         print("component created")

      def onConnect(self):
         print("transport connected")
         self.join(self.config.realm)

      def onChallenge(self, challenge):
         print("authentication challenge received")

      def onJoin(self, details):
         print("session joined")

      def onLeave(self, details):
         print("session left")

      def onDisconnect(self):
         print("transport disconnected")


Upgrading
---------

From < 0.8.0
............

Starting with release 0.8.0, |Ab| now supports WAMP v2, and also support both Twisted and asyncio. This required changing module naming for WAMP v1 (which is Twisted only).

Hence, WAMP v1 code for |ab| **< 0.8.0**

.. code-block:: python

   from autobahn.wamp import WampServerFactory

should be modified for |ab| **>= 0.8.0** for (using Twisted)

.. code-block:: python

   from autobahn.wamp1.protocol import WampServerFactory

.. warning:: WAMP v1 will be deprecated with the 0.9 release of |Ab| which is expected in Q4 2014.


From < 0.9.4
............

Starting with release 0.9.4, all WAMP router code in |Ab| has been split out and moved to `Crossbar.io <http://crossbar.io>`_. Please see the announcement `here <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/autobahnws/bCj7O2G2sxA/6-pioJZ_S_MJ>`__.
