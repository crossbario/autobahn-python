## HTTP Status Codes
##
## Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes
## Adapted on 2011/10/11
##

##
## 1xx Informational
##
## Request received, continuing process.
##
## This class of status code indicates a provisional response, consisting only of
## the Status-Line and optional headers, and is terminated by an empty line.
## Since HTTP/1.0 did not define any 1xx status codes, servers must not send
## a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 client except under experimental conditions.
##

HTTP_STATUS_CODE_CONTINUE                 = (100, "Continue",
                                             "This means that the server has received the request headers, and that the client should proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be sent; for example, a POST request). If the request body is large, sending it to a server when a request has already been rejected based upon inappropriate headers is inefficient. To have a server check if the request could be accepted based on the request's headers alone, a client must send Expect: 100-continue as a header in its initial request[2] and check if a 100 Continue status code is received in response before continuing (or receive 417 Expectation Failed and not continue).")

HTTP_STATUS_CODE_SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS      = (101, "Switching Protocols",
                                             "This means the requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server is acknowledging that it will do so.")

HTTP_STATUS_CODE_PROCESSING               = (102, "Processing (WebDAV) (RFC 2518)",
                                             "As a WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, it may take a long time to complete the request. This code indicates that the server has received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet.[3] This prevents the client from timing out and assuming the request was lost.")

HTTP_STATUS_CODE_CHECKPOINT               = (103, "Checkpoint",
                                             "This code is used in the Resumable HTTP Requests Proposal to resume aborted PUT or POST requests.")

##
## 2xx Success
##
## This class of status codes indicates the action requested by the client was
## received, understood, accepted and processed successfully.

                                             "Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used. In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource. In a POST request the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.")

HTTP_STATUS_CODE_CREATED                  = (201, "Created",
                                             "The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.")

                                             "The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not eventually be acted upon, as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes place.")

HTTP_STATUS_CODE_NON_AUTHORATIVE          = (203, "Non-Authoritative Information (since HTTP/1.1)",
                                             "The server successfully processed the request, but is returning information that may be from another source.")

                                             "The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content. Unlike a 204 response, this response requires that the requester reset the document view.")

HTTP_STATUS_CODE_PARTIAL_CONTENT          = (206, "Partial Content",
                                             "The server is delivering only part of the resource due to a range header sent by the client. The range header is used by tools like wget to enable resuming of interrupted downloads, or split a download into multiple simultaneous streams.")

HTTP_STATUS_CODE_MULTI_STATUS             = (207, "Multi-Status (WebDAV) (RFC 4918)",
                                             "The message body that follows is an XML message and can contain a number of separate response codes, depending on how many sub-requests were made.")

HTTP_STATUS_CODE_IM_USED                  = (226, "IM Used (RFC 3229)",
                                             "The server has fulfilled a GET request for the resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more instance-manipulations applied to the current instance.")

##
## 3xx Redirection
##
## The client must take additional action to complete the request.
##
## This class of status code indicates that further action needs to be taken
## by the user agent in order to fulfil the request. The action required may
## be carried out by the user agent without interaction with the user if and
## only if the method used in the second request is GET or HEAD. A user agent
## should not automatically redirect a request more than five times, since such
## redirections usually indicate an infinite loop.
##

HTTP_STATUS_CODE_MULTIPLE_CHOICES         = (300, "Multiple Choices",
                                             "Indicates multiple options for the resource that the client may follow. It, for instance, could be used to present different format options for video, list files with different extensions, or word sense disambiguation.")

                                             "This is an example of industrial practice contradicting the standard. HTTP/1.0 specification (RFC 1945) required the client to perform a temporary redirect (the original describing phrase was 'Moved Temporarily', but popular browsers implemented 302 with the functionality of a 303 See Other. Therefore, HTTP/1.1 added status codes 303 and 307 to distinguish between the two behaviours. However, some Web applications and frameworks use the 302 status code as if it were the 303.")

HTTP_STATUS_CODE_SEE_OTHER                = (303, "See Other (since HTTP/1.1)",
                                             "The response to the request can be found under another URI using a GET method. When received in response to a POST (or PUT/DELETE), it should be assumed that the server has received the data and the redirect should be issued with a separate GET message.")

                                             "Indicates the resource has not been modified since last requested.[2] Typically, the HTTP client provides a header like the If-Modified-Since header to provide a time against which to compare. Using this saves bandwidth and reprocessing on both the server and client, as only the header data must be sent and received in comparison to the entirety of the page being re-processed by the server, then sent again using more bandwidth of the server and client.")

                                             "No longer used. Originally meant 'Subsequent requests should use the specified proxy'.")

HTTP_STATUS_CODE_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT       = (307, "Temporary Redirect (since HTTP/1.1)",
                                             "In this occasion, the request should be repeated with another URI, but future requests can still use the original URI.[2] In contrast to 303, the request method should not be changed when reissuing the original request. For instance, a POST request must be repeated using another POST request.")

HTTP_STATUS_CODE_RESUME_INCOMPLETE        = (308, "Resume Incomplete",
                                             "This code is used in the Resumable HTTP Requests Proposal to resume aborted PUT or POST requests.")

##
## 4xx Client Error
##
## The 4xx class of status code is intended for cases in which the client
## seems to have erred. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server
## should include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation,
## and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status codes are
## applicable to any request method. User agents should display any included
## entity to the user. These are typically the most common error codes
## encountered while online.
##

HTTP_STATUS_CODE_BAD_REQUEST              = (400, "Bad Request",

Upon receiving a 410 status code, the client should not request the resource again in the future. Clients such as search engines should remove the resource from their indices.
