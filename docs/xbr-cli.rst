Crypto Wallet
.............

XBR is based on the `Ethereum blockchain <https://ethereum.org/>`__, and all XBR data markets, market operators
and actors (buyers & sellers) in markets are registered on the Ethereum blockchain.

.. note::

    Currently, XBR is still in alpha, and the latest version is XBR v20.4.2 deployed on Rinkeby testnet.
    XBR will be deployed on mainnet with the official stable release.

Market operators and market actors (buyers & sellers) maintain their (potentially anonymous) identity
via crypto wallets where the private wallet key is under exclusive access to the operator or actor.

Running your own crypto wallet is easy using `MetaMask <https://metamask.io/>`__, a browser plugin that runs
in Chrome and Firefox.

First step is to install MetaMask, creating a new wallet:

.. image:: _static/screenshots/xbr-metamask-1.png

and connect to `Rinkeby testnet <https://www.rinkeby.io/>`__:

.. image:: _static/screenshots/xbr-metamask-2.png

Then, to use your Ethereum private key with the XBR CLI, export the private key:

.. image:: _static/screenshots/xbr-metamask-3.png

.. code-block:: console

    --ethkey=0x4C1F...

.. note::

    Obviously, you must protect your *private key*! The *public address* of your wallet is not security
    sensitive. Even the public address however should always be treated carefully regarding privacy.

Finally, for testing on Rinkeby, get yourself some Ether from the `Rinkeby faucet <https://faucet.rinkeby.io/>`__:

.. image:: _static/screenshots/rinkeby-faucet.png

If you want to use the accounts from your MetaMask wallet derived from your wallet's seedphrase, you can
use a helper included with Autobahn to derive private keys for all accounts, eg account `0`:

.. code-block:: console

    >>> from autobahn.xbr import account_from_seedphrase
    >>> acct = account_from_seedphrase('myth like bonus scare over problem client lizard pioneer submit female collect', 0)
    >>> acct.address
    '0x90F8bf6A479f320ead074411a4B0e7944Ea8c9C1'
    >>> acct.privateKey.hex()
    '0x4f3edf983ac636a65a842ce7c78d9aa706d3b113bce9c46f30d7d21715b23b1d'
    >>>


Client Key
..........

To connect to the XBR Network using the XBR CLI, the client (which connects via WAMP) needs a client private
key (used for WAMP-cryptosign authentication).

A new key can be created by generating 32 random bytes:

.. code-block:: console

    $ openssl rand -hex 32
    ecdc5e97...

When using the XBR CLI, provide your WAMP client key using the command line argument ``--cskey=0x`` appended
with your key:

.. code-block:: console

    --cskey=0xecdc5e97...


Profile
-------

To create a new user profile:

.. code-block:: console

    $ xbrnetwork
    created new local user directory /home/oberstet/.xbrnetwork
    creating new user profile "default"
    enter a XBR data market URL: wss://markets.international-data-monetization-award.com/ws
    enter the WAMP realm of the XBR data market: idma
    your private Etherum key: 0x4C1F7...
    your private WAMP client key: 0x7e8f...
    your Infura gateway key: 40c69...
    your Infura gateway secret: 55119...
    created new local user configuration /home/oberstet/.xbrnetwork/config.ini
    user profile "default" loaded


On-boarding
-----------

To on-board and register in the XBR Network using the CLI, submit a request providing your Ethereum private key, your
client key, as well as your username and email:

.. code-block:: console

    $ xbrnetwork register-member \
    --cskey=0x7e8f... \
    --ethkey=0x4C1F7... \
    --username=oberstet5 \
    --email=tobias.oberstein@gmail.com

.. note::

    Of course, neither your username nor your email is stored on-chain (on the blockchain). Your email is required so that
    we can send a verification code to you (see next step).

You should receive an email with a verification action ID such as ``072061e8-d1b4-4988-9524-6873b4d5784e`` and
a verification code such as ``5QRM-R5KR-7PGU``.

Verify the on-boarding request using the verification action and code:

.. code-block:: console

    $ xbrnetwork register-member-verify \
    --cskey=0x7e8f... \
    --ethkey=0x4C1F7... \
    --vaction=072061e8-d1b4-4988-9524-6873b4d5784e \
    --vcode=5QRM-R5KR-7PGU

To access your member profile, run:

.. code-block:: console

    xbrnetwork get-member \
    --cskey=0x7e8f... \
    --ethkey=0x4C1F7...


Joining a market
----------------

To join a XBR data market, you will need the XBR data market ID, such as ``1388ddf6-fe36-4201-b1aa-cb7e36b4cfb3``
(which is the IDMA test market).

Here is how to join as an actor in that market as both a buyer and seller:

.. code-block:: console

    $ xbrnetwork join-market \
    --cskey=0x7e8f... \
    --ethkey=0x4C1F7... \
    --market=1388ddf6-fe36-4201-b1aa-cb7e36b4cfb3 \
    --actor_type=3

You will receive an email with a verification action ID and a verification code. Submit these
to complete joining the market:

.. code-block:: console

    xbrnetwork join-market-verify \
    --cskey=0x7e8f... \
    --ethkey=0x4C1F7... \
    --vaction=ddcd5452-28cc-4ecb-a0f3-8fc8b596f9a5 \
    --vcode=AGGA-PK6G-57NY

To access your actor status in a market, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ xbrnetwork get-actor \
    --cskey=0x7e8f... \
    --ethkey=0x4C1F7... \
    --market=1388ddf6-fe36-4201-b1aa-cb7e36b4cfb3
