# AI Collaboration Guide for the WAMP Project

*This guide is maintained for AI assistants collaborating on WAMP and related projects. When in doubt, be explicit and paranoid.*

**Philosophy**: "Dead simple, paranoid, hands-on engineering"

- Explicit is better than magic
- If it's not in version control, it doesn't exist
- Everything must be self-contained and reproducible
- Zero tolerance for system (Python) pollution
